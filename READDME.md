Data Flow Explanation
Product Hierarchy:
Products belong to categories (with possible subcategories)
Products are associated with brands
Products have a base price that can be overridden at the item level

Variation System:
Products can have variations based on color and size
Each unique combination creates a product variation
Product items (inventory) are tied to specific variations

Inventory Management:
Product items represent actual inventory with SKUs
Each item has its own quantity and price (which can differ from base price)
Items can be tracked by their specific variations

Attribute System:
Products can have custom attributes organized by categories
Attributes can be of different types (text, number, boolean)
This allows for flexible product specifications
